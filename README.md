# Welcome to k6-Learn

This repo contains resources for:
- creating slide presentations
- giving a workshop
- speaking about k6
- learning about k6

## Starter slide deck

[Here's a starter slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gviRg7RTzT0Y2_5WPBADyn5xpa96PIqWivGAThNW6pM/edit?usp=sharing) that you can copy, modify to your use case, and present. It is only intended to be a jumping off point, so you can remove slides that wouldn't appeal to your audience or add new ones to show off your style more.

## What if I want something more hands on?

Consider running a workshop for k6. Below is an outline of what that workshop could look like, as well as modules you could use for each topic. Feel free to take these and include the parts most relevant to you!
